        "- TextMentionTermination: If a keyword like \"DONE\" appears in the response, the system stops generating text. This is useful for signaling the completion of a task, when the meal plan for the whole day is finalized, the system stops with \"DONE\". However, there is a downside using this method when the keyword shows up in content of the meal plan (e.g. if \"DONE\" is a part of recipe or cooking instruction). To improve this, complex keyword can be used such as \"MEALPLANDONE\" this keyword has a lower chance of showing up in the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "- MaxMessageTermination: If the certain number of messages is exceeded, the system stops producing response. Upside is to limit messages length when outputting text. The downside is it might cut off important or useful information if the limit is set too low, regardless of whether the planning is complete.\n",
        " \n",
        "- HandoffTermination: The system stops when the agent sends a HandoffMessage. Useful when the system wants to have input from the user, for example, if the system wants to know if the user like the meal plan that it makes at any paricular part of the day. Also if the cost is exceeds the budget, the team can ask what item the user wants to keep. The challenge here is ensuring the handoff only sent message when it really needs to.\n",

        "- Economic: Each message or interaction in the system costs fee, from API calls to token usage. Iterations produce more cost. Lengthy texts cause inconvinients for the user.\n",
        "- Potential miscommunication: From the setup, if one agent misses a message from another, there's a risk of miscommunication.\n",
        "- Scalability issues: As the complexity of the imput prompt from the user increases, this method might not scale well with modifications. The structure might reach a bottleneck for complex meals plan.\n",
        "- No feedback loop: The approach doesn't ask inputs from the user, making things hard to customize."
